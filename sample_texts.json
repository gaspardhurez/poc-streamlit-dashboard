{"Positive": ["the phone was unlocked and it works just like new!", "i like it.", "so far amazing! i have an iphone 6s, and this has paired smoothly without any downloads or qr code. i bought the \"silver plus,\" which has updated software. my calls are very clear. i can call out and receive calls. i can use the calendar, alarms (vibrate or chimes), i can also set the ringer to vibrate or ringtone or both. i can take pictures, record video and voice recordings, and the sound quality is great. i also added a 32g mini sd chip for storage, and the watch has a handy file manager that shows the album covers to all of music, once i select the song. the fm radio is terrific; the watch comes with a set of headphones that work with the watch, and the software interface is as nice as the \"brand\" name that this watch looks identical to. (sams#$% neo 2 wink) this smartwatch provides an excellent hands free way to receive calls. it has a quality build and the band is a very soft and flexible silicon-like rubber. my only complaint at all with this watch is that it easily synced all the contacts from my iphone, yet it didn't transfer the numbers, only the names. still troubleshooting that. for the price, the look, and the fast phone functions on your wrist, this is a great buy and i am hoping it will have a decent lifespan. will update if anything odd or unfortunate happens. i am very surprised and pleased for now! :)", "nice phone with a great display and even greater camera. finger print sensor is a sore miss. lte band in india not working", "we bought this phone for a trip to greece this summer and it worked fine. we were able to put in a greek sim card and make calls in greece. no idea how it will hold up for future trips but so far so good.", "the best phone. no problems with it. fast delivery. the phone can also be used as a tablet...so for me, its a phablet. love it", "just what i needed. thank you.", "this phone is very good and have wonderful apps on the phone and the only thing i dont like it dont have the block call on the phone u have to buy the app", "i was skeptical of this before buying but gave it a try and i'm glad i did. the sound quality is great and had no issues connecting to at&t service. popped my sim card in and instant service. i've had it for a few months now and still working great. the free case is okay but would consider buying something better for durability and protection. the ear buds are decent. i recommend this :)", "great"], "Neutral": ["the phone is great, but all i received was the phone and the charger. no headphones, or charm, not even the doc...", "phone performed great, but it didn't have support of all the bands on t-mobile's network, so there was no lte on the phone. returned and found a lumia 1520.3.", "the only problem is the charge. i can only use the compute for battery. the charger is not for us plug.", "i've had this phone for almost a month now and i want to let it be known that it is not perfect.. this is not the usa version of the galaxy mega which i discovered when looking to buy a case in my local mall.. also my weather app has crashed and won't work..my gps location services won't work..the phone does not seem to have the s beam feature which it should be equipped with.. and when using the search feature my phone displays chinese characters.. i do not know the cause for any of these flaws nor how to correct them. however i have enjoyed using this phone and i haven't had any problem using this phone on the straight talk network.. so overall i am satisfied with this phone but it is lacking some key features and does have its flaws", "nice phone, a bit too big. screen 'tears' while gaming. looks like a flash of lightning when graphics are stressed...as a gamer, this is not the phone for me... metro pcs took the phone back, but only refunded me $80... wasn't worth the risk.", "before being an iphone junkie, this phone was perfect for me. it's durable and good in all aspects. the only thing is the same thing that all bb has: software is very unstable. but when you buy one, you know it.", "its a nice cellphone.. the only thing i hate is that everytime i change the simcard i must add apv config", "just a basic phone.. nothing really wow about it.. put in my two sims and received and made calls.. if that is what you are looking for.. go ahead and purchase.", "i returned this phone for only one reason - the piston 2 headphones do not play on it. this phone, and lg g2 mini (my previous phone) only play music on lg headphones and audio technica headphones without any issues. i find this very disappointing, and i do not like when i see any kind of monopoly and making buyers buy certain products. other than that, i think the phone is probably good. i know i have been happy with my lg g2 mini in any other expect, but the headphones issue. i was hoping lg g3 beat wouldn't have the same problem, but it does. so, probably not a phone for audiophiles.", "it's a ok phone with the storage but the camera doesn't have a flash which really sucks for the size of phone it is. i have had the phone for about a month and my charger port has stopped working. i really would like to send it back because it is a struggle trying to get the phone to charge."], "Negative": ["phone has started to heat up and then shuts down. have to take battery out to reactivate. we'd return it but the days of return policy have passed.", "i had my phone for about 3 weeks now and it was freaking out after a week.i s sucks bad.sorry", "unfortunately i ordered the lg g3 d855 and i got stuck with the lg g3 vs985...", "hi canguro, i received the phone a month ago and for the date 12/07/2015 is presenting a line on the screen, so you would validate the warranty. thanks,annex the pictures to validate.", "camera is great, and the phone has a replaceable battery, but the phone just started to \"fail\". i couldn't always swipe to answer calls. the screens would all merge together. had to constantly restart the phone!", "i haven't been able to use this device because its been asking me to dial a number for activation, however, it hasn't given me the number to call. i am going to have to order a different type of phone for me to use", "it only works 3 monthsthe j series are bad products", "the phone was a good phone, but now it doesn't start. only appear the message blu products. and nothing happens. sometimes start, and sometimes doesn't start. at all is a good phone, but now has this problem.", "bought the note 2 in dec 2012. and on june 20th i charged the phone and came back it was \"off\". tried to turn it on and nothing. cant reboot do nothing with it. oh and my phone in gsm international and from the uk. so i can mail it to them but they cant mail it back to me. and samsung us cant fix it because yeah its from the uk. so by samsung never in my life will i buy a product from them again. buy at your own risks. if you look up galaxy s2, s3 note 2 online you will see that 95% of their owners got the same problem.", "was for my 75 yr old mother. she doesn't like it....to small for her."]}
